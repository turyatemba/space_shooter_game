#### space_shooter_game
 simple space shooting game made with unity 
 this is WebGL build version of the game 
#### Set up 
 Use a local server to play this game such as apache or wamp
 if you have unity , import the game and "build and run" , it will automatically create a local server and open the game on your default browser 
 from attempts i have made, chrome and safari could not load the web page because of security reasons 
 To load the index page you can run chrome with the following command in terminal for mac 
 open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files
 
###### Contorls
Use the WASD keys to navigate and Space to shoot. To start game, shoot the rock for enemy spawning to begin

##### Menus
menus have been disabled because of the build nature of the game. A full game will be shared on https://itch.io/ soon with fixed bugs like enemy shooting 
Multiply has also been disabled for this WebGl build 

Enjoy!!
